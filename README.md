# Trading Oleos
This 5 part series has been created due to the abundance of ... unexperienced developers entering NUFT and causing a lot of trouble for the community. This series will cover the basics of what we do software-wise, and is intended to be a prerequisite to all other development-related roles in NUFT. 

## Pre-requisites
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed.   
- A UNIX environment (WSL, Linux, MacOS, MinGW/[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), etc.)
- A basic understanding of C++ and Python.
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub.

## [Part 0: Debugging, Logs, PRs, and other non-code things](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-0)
This will be a relatively quick introduction to debugging non-local code, reading logs, unit testing (real), and creating PRs.    

## [Part 1: Novel Code and Pybind](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-1)
Writing new code, and a basic introduction to using PyBind11 to call C++ from Python without `ctypes` directly.

## [Part 2: Main C++ Work](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-2)
Creating the bulk of the requisite C++ code for the project. 

## [Part 3: Code Completion, Coverage, Test Suite](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-3)

## [Part 4: Pybinding and Integration Testing](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-4)

## [Part 5: Formalize and Wrap Up](https://github.com/echavemann/learnsomething/tree/Step-5)
