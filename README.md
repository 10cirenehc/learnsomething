# Trading Oleos
This 5 part series has been created due to the abundance of ... unexperienced developers entering NUFT and causing a lot of trouble for the community. This series will cover the basics of what we do software-wise, and is intended to be a prerequisite to all other development-related roles in NUFT. 

## Part 0: Debugging, Logs, PRs, and other non-code things   
This will be a relatively quick introduction to debugging non-local code, reading logs, unit testing (real), and creating PRs.    

## Part 1: C++ and Senior Devs.

## Part 2: Introduction to "Your" Codebase. 

## Part 3: Code Completion

## Part 4: Pybinding and Integration Testing.

## Part 5: Formalize and Wrap Up.
