# Trading Oleos
This 5 part series has been created due to the abundance of ... unexperienced developers entering NUFT and causing a lot of trouble for the community. This series will cover the basics of what we do software-wise, and is intended to be a prerequisite to all other development-related roles in NUFT. 

## Pre-requisites
- CMake, Taskfile.dev, Git, and Python3 installed.   
- A UNIX environment (WSL, Linux, MacOS, etc.)
- A basic understanding of C++ and Python.
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub.

## Part 0: Debugging, Logs, PRs, and other non-code things   
This will be a relatively quick introduction to debugging non-local code, reading logs, unit testing (real), and creating PRs.    

## Part 1: Novel Code and Pybind.
Writing new code, and a basic introduction to using PyBind11 to call C++ from Python without `ctypes` directly.

## Part 2: C++ Main Work.
Creating the bulk of the requisite C++ code for the project. 

## Part 3: Code Completion, Coverage, Test Suite.

## Part 4: Pybinding and Integration Testing.

## Part 5: Formalize and Wrap Up.
