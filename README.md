# Trading Oleos
This 5 part series has been created due to the abundance of ... unexperienced developers entering NUFT and causing a lot of trouble for the community. This series will cover the basics of what we do software-wise, and is intended to be a prerequisite to all other development-related roles in NUFT. 

## Pre-requisites
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed.   
- A UNIX environment (WSL, Linux, MacOS, MinGW/[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), etc.)
- A basic understanding of C++ and Python.
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub.
